#3D Objects

The creation of tridimentionals objects is not something new in the digital fabrication field. Using 3D printers, normally based in material adition, it is possible to create any shape as desired with high precision. Unfortunetly, there is a considereble limitation in this process: the selection of materials is limited. Most of the 3D printers use melted plastic for in the process and fell use some different solid material. Normally the model can be done in different colors but in any cases we can't switch the materials to create something more durable.

#The alternative way

So, considering we want a tridimentional model but we don't wanna use the expensive same-allways plastic, an alternative way to make it is folding bidimentional plans. The principle is very simple: like an origami a flat surface is marked and folded to create tridimentional forms. To create more durable and elaborated objects, we add some digital fabrication skills that allows the usage of different materials and simplifies the manual work. Using a 2D laser cutter it is possible to mark and fold almost any kind of plate, like plywood, mdf, acrilic, rubber, cardboard or even some types of fabric. The final results are always very interesting and you can get cooler surfaces than a regular smoth 3D printer.
